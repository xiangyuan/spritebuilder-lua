 SpriteBuilder-lua
===================
SpriteBuilder runtime for cocos2dx-lua(v3quick)

 Why this project.
-------------------
  * There's no SpriteBuilde runtime for cocos2dx-lua(v3quick).
  * Lua is fast enough to handle UI and simple animations.
  * (Quick-UI)(the Lua implemention of UI frameworks in v3quick) is as good as the C++ implemention in cocos2dx(c++). 

 About this implemention.
-------------------
 * Expande the Quick-UI or add SpriteBuilder plugin if needed.
 * Convert *.ccb file to json, for json is easier to read than xml in Lua. 
In this project, I'll just use a cmdline tool called __plutil__.
 * __Not__ All feature will be implemented in the first version.

About the example.
------------------
 * The example is based on v3quick-3.3 version.
