 SpriteBuilder-lua
===================
SpriteBuilder runtime for cocos2dx-lua(v3quick)

 Why this project.
-------------------
> 1. There's no SpriteBuilde runtime for cocos2dx-lua(v3quick).
> 2. Lua is fast enough to handle UI and simple animations.
> 3. (Quick-UI)(the Lua implemention of UI frameworks in v3quick) is as good as the C++ implemention in cocos2dx(c++). 

 About this implemention.
-------------------

> 1. Expande the the Quick-UI if needed.
> 2. Convert *.ccb file to json, for json is easier to read than xml in Lua. 
In this project, I'll just use a cmd line tool called __plutil__.
> 3. __Not__ All feature will be implemented in the first version.
